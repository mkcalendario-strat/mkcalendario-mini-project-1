          I am currently interning at Stratpoint Inc., a leading digital
          transformation company, where I joined before graduation as a Software
          Engineer specializing in web development using React JS. This role is
          helping me build my path in the tech industry by gaining valuable
          hands-on experience.

          During my internship, I have been involved in tasks such as feature
          implementation, debugging, and collaborating with cross-functional
          teams. This has given me practical exposure to Scrum practices and how
          agile teams operate to deliver quality software.

          essential to shaping my future career in technology.
