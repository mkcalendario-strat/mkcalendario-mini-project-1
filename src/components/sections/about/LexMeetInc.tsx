          My internship at LexMeet Inc. was my first official work experience in
          a corporate setting, required by our school. I joined the front-end
          development team, where I worked on building responsive and
          user-friendly UI pages for the companyâ€™s website.

          During my internship, I took initiative in organizing and maintaining
          the front-end codebase, which helped improve its structure,
          readability, and scalability. This gave me valuable insights into how
          scalable applications are maintained in a collaborative development
          environment.

          Collaboration was key during this internship. I worked closely with
          co-interns and supervisors using Git and GitLab for version control,
          code reviews, and task coordination. This experience gave me a clearer
          picture of the software development lifecycle in a real-world tech
          company.
